######################################################################

0.18  (03/27/2017)
    (ms) L. Alberto Gim√©nez reported empty print lines in case of 
         Net::SSH::AuthorizedKeysFile running with Log::Log4perl
         enabled. Fixed.

0.17  (12/22/2014)
    (ms) David Leon Gil added support for Ed25519 keys

0.16  (01/31/2012)
    (ms) Added support for ecdsa-* ssh-2 keys, requested by
         Christian Ruppert.

0.15  (02/16/2011)
    (ms) No longer using $& to eliminate both real and imaginary
         performance penalties.

0.14  (12/20/2010)
    (ms) Preserve order of options
    (ms) Bug fix: Binary options no longer expand as xxx="1" in as_string()

0.13  (2010/04/25)
    (ms) Moved ssh1 and ssh2 docs to base class.
    (ms) Added sanity check for files with extreme line lengths
    (ms) Added convenience methods path_locate() and ssh_dir() to locate 
         a user's .ssh dir and authorized_keys file on disk.
    (ms) Added fingerprint method to parser base class, determining
         a key's functional uniqueness.

0.12  (2010/02/22)
    (ms) Added test cases with weird keys
    (ms) Deleting undefined/empty options to avoid warnings

0.11  (2009/11/30)
    (ms) Documentation fixes
    (ms) Added github repo link to Makefile.PL

0.10  2009/11/15
    (ms) Complete rewrite of parsers and classes
    (ms) No longer supporting multi-line keys

0.06  2009/10/20
    (ms) new() no longer reads the configuration file
         automatically, read() must be called separately. This breaks
         backward compatibility. Sorry, but it had to be fixed.
  
    (ms) Even odd cases of authorized_keys files are now handled 
         correctly (but of course there could be even odder cases
         that caused the parser to bail :)

0.05  2009/08/07
    (ms) Ignore empty lines
    (ms) Allow multi-lines for ssh2 pubkeys
    (ms) Fixes for more resilience towards mistyped authkey files

0.04  2009/08/07
    (ms) Allow mixed v1/v2 keys in a single authorized_keys file.

0.03  2008/08/24
    (ms) Rewrote entire parsing code to comply with ssh spec, thanks to 
         Tobias Galitzien for the pointer.
    (ms) Ignore comment lines in authorized_keys files
    (ms) The 'email' field is now call 'comment' ('email' is still available 
         for backwards compatibility, though).
    (ms) Comments can now contain blanks and commas without tripping the
         parser up.

0.02  2005/12/23
    (ms) Fixed dependencies

0.01  2005/12/21
    (ms) Where it all began.
